Prodigy Infotech Landing Page

This landing page was developed as part of my Web Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech.

Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Font Awesome (for icons)

Project Overview:
This is a fully responsive and interactive landing page designed to represent Prodigy Infotech. It includes:

- Homepage with animated text and visuals  
- Services section showcasing company offerings  
- Internship listings with an application form popup  
- Counselling section with booking options  
- FAQ section with interactive toggle  
- Contact form with support details

Deployment & Usage:
The code is structured into separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for clarity. It can be run locally using any browser or with the Live Server extension in VS Code.
